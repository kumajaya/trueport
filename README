           Perle TruePort Daemon and  Driver for Linux
           Copyright (C) 2004-2020, Perle Systems Limited
=============================================================================

  Release           : 6.10.1
  Date              : May 2020
  O/S Compatibility : Linux Versions 2.6.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x

=============================================================================

Introduction: 
=============

This is the readme belonging to the TruePort for Linux software. 


TruePort for Linux is a TTY serial port emulation system for the 
Perle device/terminal server families. TruePort provides a standard
TTY interface to application software which is achieved using the
TruePort serial device driver.

TruePort provides a more general interface via a fixed /dev TTY name,
this allows application software to send and receive data from ports on the
terminal server as if they were directly connected to the application server.


TruePort Full mode protocol will allow an application to take full control of the 
remote serial port and use all functions available e.g. setting baud rates, flow
control settings and raising and lowering modem pins etc.

TruePort Lite Mode will allow an application to just transmit and receive data 
to and from the port.  Any baud rates or flow control settings must be 
configured on the terminal server before the application is started.

TruePort supports the following Perle hardware in TruePort Full mode
protocol:
    - All IOLAN Family Models, including DS, TS, SDS, STS, SCS
    - JetStream 8500, JetStream 4000
    - LanStream 2000
    - LinkStream 2000.

It also supports IOLAN+ and other 3rd party multi-port terminal servers in Lite
(raw) mode.

NOTE: 	
For TruePort Full Mode the JetStream 8500, JetStream 4000 and LanStream 2000 
require firmware version 2.3.3 or later and the LinkStream 2000 requires 
version 6.04 or later.


Installation and Configuration:
===============================

The software consist of two parts. The part that allows a user-program
to control a fully-functional serial port is a driver in the form of a  new 
loadable kernel driver.

The other part is the daemon that handles the connection between the
kernel driver and a device/terminal server.

Installation using the .tgz file
--------------------------------

Unpack the file and go to the created directory. In the directory run 
the script:

   ./tar_install.sh

TruePort administrative files and utilities are installed in the /etc/trueport 
and /usr/bin directories.

To create and enable a range of ports we have provided a script "addports"
that starts the TruePort service. The "addports" command edits the TruePort 
configuration files and starts the required daemons and drivers.  

Once the "addports" command has configured the system, TruePort will be started 
automatically on each system reboot.

Once the ports have been enabled, you may use them as standard UNIX serial TTY's.

See the TruePort Linux User Guide for more information on the use of this 
script and other configuration utilities.


Notes for installing large number of ports:
===========================================
 * The maximum number of ports supported by TruePort server-initiated is  
   64,512.(which is 65535-1023 ).  
 * On most Linux systems the default Process Identifiers Limit is set to 32K. 
   To display the current Process Identifiers Limit on your system type the 
	following command at the shell prompt:
      $ sysctl kernel.pid_max
        OR
      $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
   Output:
      kernel.pid_max = 32768
   The Perle TruePort driver uses a process per port so if you are installing a
   large number of ports it is possible you will need more process ID's then
   the default limit.  To allow for more PIDs type the following command:
      $ sysctl -w kernel.pid_max=80000
   To make the change survive a system reboot you will need to append the 
	following to your /etc/sysctl.conf:
      kernel.pid_max = 80000
 * If you install a large number of ports then your boot up time may be 
   significanly increased. This boot time can be reduced if udev is disabled.

	
Kernel update:
==============
When a new kernel version is installed on the machine the TruePort rpm
package has to be reinstalled to get the correct kernel module for the
new kernel. The commands to do this are:

   cd /usr/share/doc/trueport/ptyx
   make
   make install

and 
   depmod -a
   /etc/init.d/trueport restart
or
   reboot the machine

or you can simply rebuild and reinstall the rpm package. (Keep in mind
that you'll have to build the package running on the kernel that will
eventually run it)
